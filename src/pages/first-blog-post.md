Here is some jsx code:

```jsx
function Greeting() {
  return <div>Greetings traveler</div>;
}
```

Here is a test [link](https://reactjs.org/docs/)

Some inline highlighting `<Greeting />`

Now, _this should be itallic_!

**I wonder if bold works?**

```jsx{5}
// some comments
const complicatedSum = () => 2 + 2; // answer is probably 4

// more stuff
const superNumber = complicatedSum() + 38;
console.log(superNumber); // can you guess the answer?
```
